Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/last-moment-before-all-ants-fall-out-of-a-plank/
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Date: 4-11-2023
Solution: Even if ants are colliding then they are turning into opposite direction from that point, which is equivalent to if no collision happened they would have moved in similar fashion.
