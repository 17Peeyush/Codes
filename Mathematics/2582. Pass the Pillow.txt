Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/pass-the-pillow/
Approach: With 'n' people to reach from one end to another it will take 'n-1' time.
Total number of traversal from one direction to another cn be calculated as: time/(n-1)
When our total number of traversal is even we are moving forward else we are moving backward.
With the help of remainder we can find which person is holding the pillow.
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int passThePillow(int n, int time) {
        if(time ==0){
            return 1;
        }
        int q = time/(n-1); 
        int mod = time%(n-1); 
        if(q%2!=0)
        {
            return n-mod; 
        }
        else
        {
            return mod+1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
