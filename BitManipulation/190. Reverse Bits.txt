Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/description/
Companies: Google
Approach: Just from the msb i pushed it to the right and checked if it was 1 or not and then started adding from lsb.
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Code:
class Solution {
public:
    uint32_t reverseBits(uint32_t n) {
        uint32_t rev =0;
        for(int i=31,j=0;i>=0;i--,j++){
            rev = rev|((n>>i&1)<<(j));
        }
        return rev;
    }
};
