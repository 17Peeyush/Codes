Let us understand it with an example:
we have:[1,5,10]
so we will have a variable reach that denotes the maximum number we can get by combined sum of elements.
We start iterating currently reach=0, our first element is just 1 greater than the reach ideal case.
We move forward by incrementing the reach by adding first element: reach =1, idx=1
Now the current element is less than the reach. So another example suppose we have 1,5,_ ,_,9 we can create 6(1+5) , but we can't have 7, 8 any of them. if we add '7' then we can create '8'(1+7) but if we add '8' we can't have '7'. So from this observation we always try to add smallest missing number.
Currently reach=1, curr_el=5 so we will add new element that will be reach+1=2 and since '2' is added to array now our reach will become '3'(1+2)(reach+=reach+1).
Then again we will add another element '4' as soon '4' is added reach=3+4=7 we can even create 5(1+4), 6(2+4), 7(3,4).
Now our curr_element = 5 which is less than reach that means we can create it since we have it will help to extend our reach. reach+=curr_element =>reach = 12 
Now similar case for curr_element = 10
Time Complexity: O(m+logn)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
Code:
class Solution {
public:
    int minPatches(vector<int>& nums, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        long reach = 0;
        int m = nums.size();
        int i=0;
        while(reach<n){
            if(i<m&&nums[i]<=reach+1){
                reach+=nums[i];
                i++;
            }
            else{
                reach+=(reach+1);
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
